# DRINK GENIOUS: the Bar To Glass Project

This is a website that will offer two main features:

* A "random" feature that generates a cocktail using ingredients and quantities randomly associated. This creation is illustrated by a kind of animated mixology machine with the possibility of obtaining a cocktail with or without alcohol composed of 3 to 6 ingredients. A logged-in user can save the generated recipe, give it a name, and provide tips for its preparation. An admin need to valid it before appearing in the cocktail's list on the application.

* A "search" feature for cocktail recipes stored in a database created by us, listing classic recipes and  machine-generated creations that have been validated by an admin. There is an option to filter the search by alcohol type and cocktail name.

## Examples
### Example 1: The "random" feature

Marcus decides to host a birthday party, invites about ten of his friends, and wants to have a cocktail party. He doesn't necessarily want to stay behind the bar (since it's his birthday) and wants to enjoy his friends while having cocktails (with or without alcohol). He purchases various strong spirits, liqueurs, fruit juices, fruits, decorations, etc., and makes everything available to his guests on a table. He explains to his guests that each one can make their own cocktails with their own ingredients using the "Drink Genius" app. They are excited about the idea of making their own drinks and having the option to suggest them to the website later.

### User Experience:
* They discover a cocktail that has never been created before.
* They have a great time and become a mixologist for the evening.
* They can suggest their own cocktail.

### Example 2: The "search" feature:

I go to my "Drink Genius" app, check the liquors I have, initiate the search, and then see all the recipes made with these liquors, which I can further refine by cocktail name. All that's left is for me to make my choice and follow the recipe instructions!

### User Experience:
* They performed a quick search for cocktails.
* They learned a new cocktail.
* They had a great time.
